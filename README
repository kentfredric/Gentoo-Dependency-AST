NAME
    Gentoo::Dependency::AST - Convert a canonicalised (R|P|)DEPEND into an
    AST

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    Those familiar with Gentoo's "ebuild" format will be aware there are
    several variables that contain strings of dependencies that are
    required.

    Namely: "PDEPEND" , "RDEPEND" and "DEPEND"

    If you're a paludis user, one can get the canonicalised versions of
    these variables via

        cave show -c =cat/pkg-version

    This module exists to parse those strings and provide a structured graph
    representing the dependencies:

        use Gentoo::Dependency::AST;

        my $node = Gentoo::Dependency::AST->parse_dep_string( $string_from_portage );
